# Purpose
The purpose of this fork is to modify the script and make it to work with [wireguard-ui](https://github.com/ngoduykhanh/wireguard-ui) direct binanry (No Docker). Becuase this script makes wireguard installation very easy and wireguard-ui makes interface very good.
But due to some reason any client I generate with wireguard-ui does not work at all. So Let generate all clients and remove them with script and monitor only ui with wireguard-ui. 

## wireguard-install
WireGuard [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Ubuntu, Debian, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, CentOS and Fedora.

This script will let you set up your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used WireGuard before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://git.io/wireguard -O wireguard-install.sh && bash wireguard-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall WireGuard.

### I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that
